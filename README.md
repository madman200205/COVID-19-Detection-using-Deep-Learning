# COVID-19-Detection-using-CNN
This repository contains code for COVID-19 detection using deep learning techniques. The model has been implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend. The dataset used is provided.

Model Architecture

The model architecture is a convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of 1 convolutional layer, 1 max pooling layer, 1 flatten layer, 2 dense layers, and 1 output layer.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone this repository and open the project in your preferred Python IDE. The following Python packages are required to run this project:

Keras

TensorFlow

Numpy

Matplotlib

You can install these packages using the following command:

pip install keras tensorflow numpy matplotlib

Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from here. The dataset contains CT scan images of COVID-19 patients as well as normal patients. The dataset is divided into two parts: train and test.


Usage

The main code is provided in the covid_detection.ipynb file. Run this file to train and test the model. You can modify the hyperparameters of the model to improve the accuracy.

Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set.
